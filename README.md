Getting And Cleaning Data
=========================
There are two scripts which have to be executed in the following order:

1. downloadDataSet.R
2. run_analysis.R

### 1. downloadDataSet.R
This script:

1. creates a "data" subdirectory in the current working d
2. downloads the data
3. unzips the "UCI HAR Dataset" in the "data" subdirectory

### 2. run_analysis.R

details of what the script does are explained in the CodeBook.md
